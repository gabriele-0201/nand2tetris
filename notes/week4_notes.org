* Machine Languages
** Overview
Alan Turing -> concept of computing machine
Von Neunmann -> first architecture of a general computing machine

*** Instructions

There is a binary representation between binary and symbolic format (assembly format)

**** Assembly language
it simplyfy a lot of things, examples are symbols

like index to represent a certain area of the memory!

** Machine languages Elements
The assembly language is in an hardware sense WHAT the computer is able to do! The more complex the instructions are the more complex the silicon and architcture is required


*** Memory Hierarchy
Instead of having one big block of memory there wil be a sequence of memory from faster and smaller to bigger and slower.

smallest memory: registers, they are inside the cpu and they are part of the machine languages

There are
+ Data registers (where values are contained and used to perform operation)
+ Address registers (memory address will be contained in the registers)
+ Immediate (a way to use constant and insert those constant in the register)

*** Input and Output

*** Control flow
usually there is a sequential control flow

JUMP -> can be unconditionally or condintionally

** The Hack Computer and Machine Language

*** Hack computer
+ 16-bit machine
  + Data Memory (RAM) -> sequence of 16-bit registers
+ Instruction Memory (ROM) -> sequence of 16-bit registers
+ Central Processing Unit (CPU)
+ Instruction bus / data bus / address bus

*** Hack computer software
Two type of instructions, A or C each one is 16 bit long

the computer will load from the rom the sequence of instruction, use the reset butotn and then execute it

*** Registers
Three registers:
+ D: holds a 16-bit value
+ A: holds a 16-bit value
+ M: represents the 16-bit RAM register addressed by A

*** A-Instructions
```
@value
```

This has two effects:
+ register A is set to A
+ RAM[21] become the selected RAM register

*** C-instruction
```
dest = comp; jump
```

comp = computation (manay types of things you can do with)
des = destination, this can be null, and registers AMD or together
jump = if the boolan expression (comp?) is true then jump to ROM[A] (the program is saved into the ROM and here A act as the Program Counter)

Example:
```
@56 // A=56
D-1;JEQ // if (D-1==0) goto ROM[56]

0;JMP // unconditional jump
```
** Hack machine language
+ Symbolic Language
+ Binary Code

@value => 0value

the zero represent the A instruction and the last 15 bits are leaved for the non-negative decimal constant

dest = comp; jump
=>
|       1 | 1 1      | a  c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6       | d1 d2 d3    | j1 j2 j3  |
|---------+----------+----------------------------+-------------+-----------|
| op code | not used | comp bits                  | dest bits   | jump bits |
|---------+----------+----------------------------+-------------+-----------|
|         |          | there is an entire         | there is    | another   |
|         |          | table to describe          | a table     | table     |
|         |          | what computation is        | to connect  |           |
|         |          | describing the instruction | destination |           |
|         |          |                            | to  table   |           |
|---------+----------+----------------------------+-------------+-----------|

*** Hack Program
sequence of hack instructions
** Input / Output

*** Screen

How machine languages is used to describe the connection with the I/O devices (keybord, mouse or screen)

Low level approach to communicate with the I/O

To communicate with the screen is used a **Screen Memory Map** -> this area of the RAM is used describe what is displayed on the screen

The Display unit is a MATRIX (256 by 512 black or white pixels) -> each value is composed by a word(16-bit) that contains 8 pixels of the screen (on=black and off=white)

The memory is accesed by WORD -> this means that I always have to manipulate 16 bit at the time

Each raw is composed by 32 word (row is composed by 32 * 16 bits)

And the columns are composed by 256 bits, this means that there are 256 raws

THIS MEANS THAT the pixel pointed by a row and col is the i-th word, i = 32*row + col/16

The the pixel that we want to manipulate in that word is col % 16

*** Keyboard

There is a keyboard memory map, but are only needed 16-bits, this means that only one register is required to manage the communication with the keyboard

** Hack Programming Language
*** Registers and Memorys
The Hack Assembly manages access to memory and registers using only three registers: A, D and M

The simulator will execute the hack program and continue infinitelly (PC increase every time), a computer NEVER stand still, we should create an inifite to end prperly the program

**** Virtual Registers
They are labled from R0 to R15 (the assembler will only translate RX to X)
They are useful only because it makes easier to understand when the hack proram is accessing the first 16 registers of the machine (first 16 bytes of memory)
**** Other symbols
SCREEN -> 16384
KBD -> 24576

(base addresses of the maps)

*** Branching

To make jump easier LABELS are possible to be used, example:

```

@TEST // @2
0;JMP

(TEST) // line 2
@10
```

*** Variables
```
@10
D=A

@temp // @16
M=D
```

Every symbol that is NOT a lable is treated as a variable and translated into the assembler as a number, from 16

Using symbolic stuff we can create RELOCATABLE programs

*** Iteration
Just the sum of previous stuff, better to before create the pseudo code and then translate every instruction

*** Pointers

```
A=D+M // inside a loop we can continuosly modify A and store values in M
```
*** Input / Output
